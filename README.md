# Mflix app
This repo contains my implementation to the challenges of course M220JS - MongoDB for Javascript developers.

## Requirements
- [Node and npm](https://nodejs.org)


## Installation and Running the App
1. Download or clone the repo.
2. Install the MFlix dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Start the MFlix application by typing `npm start`.

You can then access the MFlix application at `http://localhost:5000/`


## Important Notes
This app uses a free MongoDB Atlas cluster to store all data. I have already created the Atlas cluster and imported all the data provided in the course. This repository is only for personal training purposes, please be careful how you use it.
